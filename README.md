Template_Documenter
===================

Create documenter from :http://revaxarts-themes.com/documenter/

Are you sick of including boring and hard-to-follow ReadMe text files with your items? Do you lack a tool or the expertise to create slick HTML documentation with a table of contents pane? Then you need to check out The Documenter.

The Documenter is a free online documentation tool created by ThemeForest author Xaver (RevaxArts). This tool is the reason he was selected as Community Superstar for March. Thanks Xaver, and congratulations!

I’ll let Xaver introduce his online tool in his own words (quoted from this ThemeForest forum thread):


    Are you fed up of boring text-only documentation? Is your only layout program Word? Don’t you want to offer your customers any more imageless documentation?

    The Documentor was made for all the thousands of frustrated and unsatisfied authors who try commit suicide because of NotePad-styled documentation. ;)

    I heard about some really cool guys and girls who are really good at making graphics, sounds, motion and 3D stuff, but didn’t know how to make cool documentation.
    Until now!
	
Give it a go. The Documenter is fairly self-explanatory, and you’ll get the hang of it after a bit of experimentation. You’ll find it here: http://themeforest.revaxarts.com/documenter. It’s very functional for a version 1.0 product, and Xaver definitely hasn’t finished working on it yet.

Have you used The Documenter? What do you love about it. If you have any feedback, please pass it on.
